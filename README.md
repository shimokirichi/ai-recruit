# ai-recruit

An AI powered Recruiting tool that reads the candidate resume PDF and compares it to Job Decsription and Requirements to identify Pros, Cons, Percentage Match and Questions to ask in interview.
Its a great tool to reduce work hours finding the ideal candidate and going through huge pile of PDFs. 

We plan to upgrade it to handle multiple resume PDFs in future.

## Tech Stach
- Flask is the main framework for the web application. 
- Material Dashboard Soft UI Free Template and bootstrap for the front end.
- PyPDF and other PDF libraries to read and extract text from PDFs.
- OpenAI library to connect with openai (works only if you have a valid and activated openAI API key)
